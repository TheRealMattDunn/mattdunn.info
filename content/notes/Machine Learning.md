## ML Vs AI

- AI—abilities of computers to mimic human behaviours
- ML—a subset of AI
	- Generally refers to supervised and unsupervised learning

## Concepts and Definitions

| Term                         | Definition                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example/instance/observation | Row in data set                                                                                       |
| Label                        | Value to predict. Can be numeric (requires regression model) or categorical (requires logistic model) |
| Features                     | Columns which aren't labels.                                                                          |
| Feature engineering          | Combine/transform features.                                                                           |
| One-hot encoding             | Transform categorical data to numeric. 1 or 0 to indicate whether category applies to the observation |
| Hyperparameters              | User-defined parameter used to control the learning process.                                          |

## Model Types

- Supervised learning—task driven, identifies a goal
	- Classification—predict a category
	- Regression—predict a continuous number
- Unsupervised learning—data-driven, identifies a pattern
	- Clustering
	- Association—identify underlying relationships
	- Dimensionality reduction—transform data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space
