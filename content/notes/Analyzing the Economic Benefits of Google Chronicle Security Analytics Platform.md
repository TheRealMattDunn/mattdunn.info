## Overview

- Orgs who deploy security analytics and ops in cloud—better positioned to provide secure infrastructure to the business
- [Chronicle](notes/Google%20Chronicle.md) pricing model + Google economies of scale = significant cost savings
	- For large orgs, 3.9-6x vs alternative cloud/on-prem platforms (3yr TCO analysis)

## Challenges

- Vs 2yrs ago:
	- Threat landscape evolving rapidly
	- Orgs collect/process more security data today
	- Volume of security alerts has increased
	- Attack surface has increased
	- Difficult to keep up with security needs
	- Security ops based on manual processes
	- Gaps in tools
	- Skills shortages
	- Public cloud

## Chronicle

- Security analytics platform
- Built on core Google infrastructure
- Predictable pricing based on number of employees

## Economic Validation

- Traditional platforms—data volume-based pricing models
	- Costs increase proportionately to ever-growing volumes
- Chronicle—employee-based pricing
	- Number of employees in org
	- Budget stability/predictability

## “The Bigger Truth”

- More data (i.e. more history)—orgs more likely to spot stealthy, slow-moving, long-lived threats and attacks
	- Benefit of decoupling licence from data volume
