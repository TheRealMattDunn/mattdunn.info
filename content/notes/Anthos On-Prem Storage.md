## Overview

- Block/file storage is exposed to [Anthos](notes/GCP%20Anthos.md) clusters via the Container Storage Interface (CSI)
- This is required for PersistentVolumes on [Anthos on Bare Metal](notes/Anthos%20on%20Bare%20Metal.md) (and VMwareâ€”although the choice here might be easier)
- Google partners have developed CSI drivers that have been verified against Anthos:
	- Dell EMC
	- Hitachi
	- HPE
	- NetApp
	- Portworx
	- Pure Storage
	- Robin.io
	- VMware
