## Benefits and Considerations

- [Vertex AI](notes/moc/Vertex%20AI.md) offers a flexible platform for deploying GenAI models
	- One model won't rule them allâ€”model are released frequently from different vendors, sometimes one is better than the other, but this changes
	- Model Garden offers 130+ third party models (e.g. LLaMA, Mistral etc.)
	- Having a secure platform with governance, controls etc. is more important than simply the model itself
- Choose the right model for the job
	- Technical decision, not business
	- Using [Gemini](notes/Gemini.md) for everything will be more expensive than PaLM Bison if not using multi-model
