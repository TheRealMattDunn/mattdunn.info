## Steps to Turn Process into [Machine Learning](Machine%20Learning.md) Model

![[path_to_ml.svg]]

### Individual Contributor

- Prototype
- Don't skip—leads to incorrect assumptions later
- Don't linger—knowledge can become concentrated in 1 person
- Slow to scale

### Delegation

- Increase number of employees—100s to millions
	- But—tool many stakeholders can result in organizational lock-in—"automation not possible"
- Formalize process
- Org buy in
- Identify humans in ML loop

### Digitization

- Computers perform mundane tasks
- Automation
- Lay software and infrastructure foundations—ML extra layer on top

### Big Data and Analytics

- Measure everything about ops and users
- Use data to reassess definition of success
- Hand-tuned algorithms—e.g. Google until 2015

### Machine Learning

- Complete feedback loop—automate all steps

## Moving from Experimentation to Production

- Frame the problem
	- Identify the use case
	- What?
	- Minimum requirements?
- Prepare training data
	- Exploratory data analysis—EDA
		- Improve data quality
	- Feature engineering—combine features to create new features
- Experimentation phase
	- Experiment with different models
- Evaluate
	- [Precision, recall](notes/Precision%20and%20Recall.md), F1 score, cross entropy
- Package, deploy, monitor
