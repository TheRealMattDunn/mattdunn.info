## Why?

> [!hint]
> Sell insights, not raw data

- Use data to drive business improvements
	- Data often a cost centre (expensive resources, projects, infra etc.)
		- Turn to profit centre with monetisation
- Instead of selling raw data
	- Sell insights to your customers
	- e.g. Shipping—rather than answering "where is my ship?", answer "this is the best route for your ship"
	- e.g. Retail—analyse manufacturer's market shares and sell back to manufacturers

## What is a Data Product?

> [!hint]
> Ensure the product has the user in mind

- BI and analytics
- Interactive dashboards
- Omnichannel insights
- Real-time—streaming
- Recommendations

## Data is the New Crude Oil

	- But also from selling insights from the data
- Compare with oil:
	- Ol refinery—sell to more people
