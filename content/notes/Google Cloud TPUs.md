## Overview

- Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)—developed in 2016
- Since 2012—AI compute power doubling every 3.5 months
	- CPUs and GPUs no longer able to scale
- Domain specific hardware
	- e.g. Matrix multiplication
- Faster to train [ML](notes/Machine%20Learning.md) models than GPUs
	- 27x faster
	- 38% cheaper
	- e.g. GPU 26hrs vs TPU 7.9mins
