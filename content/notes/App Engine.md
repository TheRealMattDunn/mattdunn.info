## Overview

- PaaS serverless
- Regional
- No server management/config
- Comes in two flavours:
	- App Engine Standard—first generation
	- App Engine Flexible—second generation

## App Engine Standard

- Instantaneous scale-up
	- Scales down to zero—15 minute scale down period (paid for)
- Runtimes:
	- Python 3
	- Java 11
	- Node.js
	- PHP 7
	- Ruby
	- Go 1.12+

## App Engine Flexible

- Containerized apps
	- Deploy from Dockerfile or Container Registry/Artifact Registry
- Gradual scale up
	- Best for consistent traffic
	- Scales down to one replica—useful for background tasks and SSH debugging
- Runtimes:
	- Python 2.7/3.6
	- Java 8
	- PHP 5/7
	- Ruby
	- Go
	- .Net
	- Custom runtimes

## Custom Domains

- Process:
	- Verify domain at Webmaster Central
	- Map (sub-)domain to App Engine in console, via gcloud or the API
	- Update DNS records are registrar using records generated by App Engine
- App Engine generates managed SSL certificate by default
	- Can use self-managed SSL certs
- Domain mapped to shared pool of IP addresses
	- To use a single IP: use [Load Balancing](notes/Google%20Cloud%20Load%20Balancing.md)
