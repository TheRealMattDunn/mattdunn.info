## Overview

- Allows you to define cloud and on-premises resources in human-readable config files
	- Check in to version control
	- Reuse
	- Share
- Standardized workflow across all cloud vendors
- Improves:
	- Reliability—removes config drift arising from manual changes
	- Manageability—easy to make changes

## Benefits

- Version control—track changes, perform rollbacks
- Automation—reduce human errors, increase efficiency
- Reusability—provision new, identical infrastructure as needed
- Scalability—changes can be made and applied automatically
- Collaboration—collaboration amongst teams, infrastructure managed and versioned centrally
- Audibility—complete history of all changes, useful for compliance, security, and troubleshooting

## Lifecycle

- Day 0—provision/configure initial infrastructure
- Day 1—OS/app config after initial infrastructure build
